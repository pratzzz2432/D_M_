  'Earthquake': {
    'causes':
    "Earthquakes occur due to sudden movements in the Earth's crust, mainly caused by tectonic plate shifts along fault lines. These movements generate seismic waves, leading to ground shaking. The most common causes of earthquakes include:\n\n- **Tectonic Activity**: The Earth's crust is divided into plates that constantly move. When stress builds up at the plate boundaries, it is released as an earthquake.\n- **Volcanic Eruptions**: Underground magma movement can trigger earthquakes near active volcanoes.\n- **Human Activities**: Mining, fracking, dam construction, and underground nuclear tests can induce seismic activity.\n- **Subduction Zones**: When one tectonic plate slides beneath another, intense pressure builds up, eventually causing massive quakes, often leading to tsunamis.",

  'Flood': {
    'causes':
    "Floods occur when excessive water overflows onto normally dry land. They can be triggered by both natural and human activities. Common causes include:\n\n- **Heavy Rainfall**: Prolonged or intense rain can overwhelm drainage systems and rivers, causing flooding.\n- **Cyclones and Hurricanes**: These storms bring heavy rainfall and storm surges, flooding coastal areas.\n- **Dam Failures**: Structural weaknesses or excessive water pressure can cause dams to break, releasing massive amounts of water.\n- **Deforestation**: Loss of trees reduces water absorption, increasing runoff and the risk of flash floods.\n- **Urbanization**: Concrete surfaces prevent water absorption, causing water to accumulate rapidly.\n- **Glacial Melting**: Climate change accelerates glacier melting, leading to rising water levels and floods in nearby regions.\n\nFloods can cause severe destruction, including loss of life, water contamination, building collapses, and landslides. Low-lying areas and regions near rivers are at the highest risk.",

  'Cyclone': {
    'causes':
    "Cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons in different regions, are powerful storms that form over warm ocean waters. They develop due to:\n\n- **Warm Ocean Temperatures**: Cyclones require sea surface temperatures of at least 26.5°C to fuel their growth.\n- **Low-Pressure Systems**: Warm, moist air rises, creating a low-pressure zone. As more air rushes in, the system intensifies.\n- **Coriolis Effect**: The Earth's rotation causes the cyclone to spin, with counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\n- **Moisture and Wind Conditions**: Cyclones thrive when there is minimal wind shear (abrupt changes in wind speed and direction).\n- **Climate Change**: Rising ocean temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns have increased cyclone frequency and intensity.\n\nCyclones bring extreme winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and coastal flooding, causing massive destruction to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture.",
